# TODOs (and other ideas)

_A non-prioritized list of things that are yet to come._

* Declarative connections with support for tunnel portal randomization
* Way more testing
* Auto-completion support for destinations (both `bash` & `zsh`)
* Potentially change to a more declarative configuration format (albeit more limiting)
* Background connection support - When you only want tunnel (currently only possible with -N flag to SSH)
* Sharing of inventory between users (similar to Postman collections)
* KRunner support to allow quick connection from KRunner
